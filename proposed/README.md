# Proposed

When a proposal has been `proposed`, it will be reviewed.

When there is consensus among the NuGet contributors and .NET community of the direction of the proposal, it will go into one of three states.

- `accepted` - The proposal has been accepted and work will be scheduled to implement it.
- `withdrawn` - The proposal has been rejected or withdrawn by the author.
- `implemented` - The proposal has already been accepted and implemented into the product.

For more information, see the [NuGet proposal process](../meta#nuget-proposal-process).
